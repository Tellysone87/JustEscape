<img src = "/JustEscapeTitleShot.png" width = "400">

This is my first project using Unity and C#. Just escape os a 2d top down game. The player must help Lilly to escape the alien ship. The player must find items and a means to escape.
I used pipepline lighting and AI path finding for the eniemies.
